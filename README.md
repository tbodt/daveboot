# daveboot
**daveboot** is a simple [DaveGrohl](http://davegrohl.org/) launcher. It is / was one of my first shell projects.

## Usage
To run **daveboot** you'll need to `git clone` it into your chosen location, and then `cd` into its directory and execute it:

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/trommel/daveboot ~/Desktop/daveboot
$ cd ~/Desktop/daveboot/
$ ./daveboot
```
